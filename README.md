## 🚀 Expertise

I'm a dedicated and detail-oriented Software Developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, functional, and scalable applications.  
My main focus lies in **Java Full Stack Development**, where I combine strong backend engineering with intuitive front-end design.  
I have hands-on experience working with modern frameworks and databases — from building RESTful APIs using **Spring Boot** to creating dynamic UIs with **React**.

I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and following best coding practices to ensure reliability and maintainability.  
My current interests include **microservices**, **containerization**, and **cloud deployment**. I love learning new tools that make development faster, smarter, and more efficient.

Beyond technical work, I value clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement — because great software is built by great teams, not just great code.
